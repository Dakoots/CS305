**Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment and Secure Coding Summary**

Artemis Financial is a financial services company that relies on a web-based software application to manage client data and financial transactions. The client asked us to identify software security vulnerabilities and ensure the application followed secure coding practices to protect sensitive user information.

During the vulnerability assessment, I carefully analyzed the application for potential security weaknesses, identified areas where attacks could occur, and documented findings with recommended mitigation strategies. Coding securely is crucial because it protects both user data and the company’s reputation, preventing financial loss and legal issues. Strong software security adds value by building trust with clients and reducing the risk of costly breaches.

The most challenging part of the assessment was identifying subtle vulnerabilities in the application’s authentication and data-handling processes. However, this was also helpful because it reinforced best practices for secure coding and attention to detail. I increased layers of security by implementing proper input validation, secure authentication measures, and encrypting sensitive data. In the future, I would use tools like static code analyzers, penetration testing software, and vulnerability scanners to prioritize and select effective mitigation techniques.

To ensure the software remained functional and secure after refactoring, I ran comprehensive tests to verify all features worked correctly and re-checked for any new vulnerabilities. I also used resources like secure coding guidelines, OWASP recommendations, and automated code review tools, which will be useful in future projects.

For potential employers, I can demonstrate my ability to conduct a full vulnerability assessment, apply secure coding practices, and produce clear documentation with actionable recommendations. This project shows both technical skill and an understanding of the importance of software security in a professional setting.
